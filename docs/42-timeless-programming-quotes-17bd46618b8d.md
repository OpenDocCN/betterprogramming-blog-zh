上周日(12 月 5 日)是鲍勃叔叔的生日，他是干净代码运动和敏捷宣言之父。

当我想到他的贡献时，我觉得有必要向迄今为止所有编程界的智慧承载者致敬。我不能很快想到这个，因为从六七十年的工作中收集变革性的思想不是一件容易的事情。

他们中的一些人还帮助我通过了我的高级开发人员面试，因为他们揭示了古老的、经过时间考验的编程智慧。我在下面用星号(*)标出了它们。

# 设计

```
#1:(*) Functions should do something, or answer something, but not both - Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob, Creator of Clean Code & Agile Manifesto) #2: (*) Context is worth 80 IQ points - Alan Kay (OOP pioneer) #3: Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written - Robert C. Martin#4: (*) In order to make sure our functions are doing ‘one thing’, we need to make sure that the statements within the function are all at the same level of abstraction - Robert C. Martin
```

# 算法和复杂性

```
#5: Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it - Alan Perlis (Creator, ALGOL)#6: Space is time (compact data is faster to traverse than scattered data) - Bjarne Stroustrup (Creator, C++)#7: (*) An algorithm must be seen to be believed - Donald Knuth//Personal Favorite (a recent one)#8: Alternative Big O notation:
O(1) = O(yeah)
O(log n) = O(nice)
O(n) = O(ok)
O(n²) = O(my)
O(2ⁿ) = O(no)
O(n!) = O(mg!)- [Josh Carroll](https://twitter.com/jwcarroll)
```

# 清洁工作的重要性

```
#9: The most damaging phrase in the language is..it’s always been done this way - Grace Hopper (Pioneer Computer Scientist, Inventor of Linkers)#10: It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa - Alan Perlis (Creator, ALGOL)#11: Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute - Hal Abelson (Founder, Free Software Foundation)#12: The first rule of functions is that they should be small- Robert C. Martin#13: Later equals never - LeBlanc’s Law#14: (*) Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler (Author, Programmer, Speaker)#15: (*) Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding - Burt Rutan (Designer, Voyager —the first non-stop Aircraft to fly around the world)#16: Quality is free, but only to those who are willing to pay heavily for it - Tom Demarco, Tim Lister (Authors, Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams)#17: All software sucks - Alan Cox (Contributing developer, Linux)
```

# 编程语言

```
#18: (*) Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out - Chris Pine (Author, Learn to program)#19: Actually I made up the term “object-oriented”, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind - Alan Kay (OOP pioneer)#20: The fact that ‘goto’ can do anything is exactly why we don’t use it - Bjarne Stroustrup (Creator, C++)#21: The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it - Dennis Ritchie (Creator, C)#22: It makes my head explode when there are people who think you can do everything in HTML - James Gosling (Creator, Java)#23: Haskell is faster than C++, more concise than Perl, more regular than Python, more flexible than Ruby, more typeful than C#, more robust than Java, and has absolutely nothing in common with PHP - Audrey Tang (Free Software Programmer, Haskell & Perl Community Leader)#24: SQL, Lisp, and Haskell are the only programming languages that I’ve seen where one spends more time thinking than typing - Philip Greenspun (Creator, Photo.net)#25: Programming languages are like girlfriends: The new one is better because *you* are better - Derek Sivers (Entreprenuer, Musician, TED Speaker, Programmer)
```

# 优化和性能

```
#26: Often designers do complicated things that improve the capacity on a particular hardware platform when it might actually be cheaper to buy more hardware - Martin Fowler (Author, Programmer, Speaker)#27: It’s hardware that makes a machine fast. It’s software that makes a fast machine slow - Craig Bruce#28: To optimize old code, first get rid of the fancy stuff - Bjarne Stroustrup (Creator, C++)#29: (*) If you optimize everything, you will always be unhappy - Donald Knuth (Father of Analysis of Algorithms)
```

# 可用性和设计

```
#30: If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person - Alan Cooper (Creator, Visual Basic)#32: The most common user action on a Website is to flee - Edward Tufte, (Researcher, Information Design)#33: A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem. - Donald A. Norman (Researcher & Author, User Centered Design)#34: The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers - Richard Hamming#35: That’s not what we think design is. … It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works - Steve Jobs, Apple#36: The best error message is the one that never shows up - Thomas Fuchs#37: Applications programming is a race between software engineers, who strive to produce idiot-proof programs, and the universe which strives to produce bigger idiots. So far, the Universe is winning - Rick Cook (Fantasy Author)
```

# 生产力和软件业务:

```
#38: Talk is cheap. Show me the code - Linus Torvalds (Creator, Linux)#39: Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves - Alan Kay (OOP pioneer)#40: Secret to productivity is not finding more time to do more stuff, but finding the strength to do less of the stuff that doesn't need doing - David Heinemeier Hansson (Creator, Ruby on Rails)#41: (*) Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later - Fred Brooks (Developer, IBM/360)
```

最后，我在谷歌搜索关键字`Agile`时发现了一些东西:

```
#42:Don’t let your tools become your process ― Anonymous
```

# 结论

对许多人来说，选择 42 句名言背后的秘密并不是不可预测的:

```
The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything is 42 - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
```

道格拉斯让所有好奇 42 有什么特别之处的人失望了:这只是一个玩笑。

然而，对于软件爱好者来说，42 在历史上有着特殊的地位。这恰好是他们用了几十年的超级计算解决这个难题的唯一数字:

```
Find x, y & z, where x3 + y3 + z3 = d, and d = 42
```

除了 42 之外，这个谜题在许多其他 d 值下都很容易解决。

但是，正如[比雅尼·斯特劳斯特鲁普所说](https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html)，关于编程:

> *绝对确定是一件可怕的事情。*
